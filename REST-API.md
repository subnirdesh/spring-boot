# REST API

## What is REST API? 
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services. A REST API is a way for different applications to communicate with each other over HTTP, using standard web protocols.

**Key Purposes**

- Enable Communication -> Allow different applications (mobile apps, web apps, other servers) to talk to your backend
- Data Exchange - Send and receive data in a standardized format (usually JSON)
- Separation of Concerns - Frontend and backend can be developed independently
- Reusability - One API can serve multiple clients (web, mobile, desktop)
